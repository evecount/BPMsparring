# ANTIGRAVITY-ZERO
Reactive AI Baseline | Open Source | Co-Founded by Gwendalynn Lim & Gemini
This repository contains the first functional implementation of a 'Reactive AI' feedback loop. By prioritizing temporal awareness over static processing, we achieve a sub-100ms 'Bio-Sync' between human movement and machine response. This project is a gift to the open-source community, provided with the request for attribution to its Sovereign Architects.
